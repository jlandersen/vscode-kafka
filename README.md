## Kafka explorer

The Kafka explorer shows configured clusters with their topics, brokers, consumers and configurations.

See [Kafka explorer](https://github.com/jlandersen/vscode-kafka/blob/master/docs/Explorer.md) section for more information.

## Producing messages

Define simple producers in a [.kafka](https://github.com/jlandersen/vscode-kafka/blob/master/docs/KafkaFile.md#kafkafile) file, using the following format:

```json
PRODUCER keyed-message
topic: my-topic
key: mykeyq
record content

###

PRODUCER non-keyed-json-message
topic: json-events
{
    "type": "my_test_event-{{random.number}}"
}
```

![Producers](docs/assets/kafka-file-producers.png)

See [Producing messages](https://github.com/jlandersen/vscode-kafka/blob/master/docs/Producing.md) section for more information.

## Consuming messages

Consuming topics can be done by right-clicking on a topic in the Kafka explorer, from the command palette, or from a [.kafka](https://github.com/jlandersen/vscode-kafka/blob/master/docs/KafkaFile.md#kafkafile) file:

```
CONSUMER consumer-group-id
topic: json-events
partitions: 0
from: 1
```

![Start Consumer with a .kafka file](docs/assets/start-consumer-from-kafkafile.png)

See [Consuming messages](https://github.com/jlandersen/vscode-kafka/blob/master/docs/Consuming.md) section for more information.

## Discover new cluster providers

You can search for extensions contributing cluster providers in the extension gallery, by clicking on the `Discover Cluster Providers` button (also available via the command palette):

![Discover Cluster Providers](docs/assets/kafka-explorer-discover-providers.png)

Those extensions must have the `kafka-provider` keyword in their `package.json`, eg.
```json
"keywords": [
		"kafka-provider"
],
```
